<!--Assignment 3: Basic Lighting and Shading-->

Didn't have enough time to do live host

Points Attempted:

1r. This is working when using example shader
2r. Wrote code for it, pretty sure calculations are correct. Got a vertex fetch error, could not fix.
3r. Have code written, I think it works. The wireframe circles will be drawn with what I believe to be the correct shading but when using my shader the full cylinder will not be drawn due to a vertex fetch error. 

Notes to Grader:

Honestly I feel lost, I spent a ton of time on this assignment which I don't feel is at all reflected in the finished product. I missed the first two classes because I wasn't enrolled yet, and I don't know if that's the problem or not but I am constantly struggling with making WebGl work at all. I feel pretty good on the class concepts but writing the code for it is beyond me. I had the error:
	Error: WebGL warning: drawElements: Vertex fetch requires vertex #70, but attribs only supply 36.
or something very similar to it for basically 4 days straight and I was unable to fix it even with help though in theory I know what it means. I really hope there will be additional sections or office hours added in the future because I already go to both labs and I still couldn't even finish the required portion of this lab.
