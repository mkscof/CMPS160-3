<!--Assignment 2 - Generalized Cylinder Wireframe-->

<!--I had not realized live hosting was necessary because I enrolled
	in the class late and I did not submit the standard way for asg1.
	I am unable to get the live hosting working since the deadline is in a few minutes,
	so I will include all the local files in the zip. I used firefox for testing, should work on that browser-->

<!--I only attempted the required points, the color change works, attempted to allow for multiple cylinders -> user can keep creating cylinders after right click but they are connected, cannot fix this in time.-->
